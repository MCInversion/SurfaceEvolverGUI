SurfaceEvolverGUI (RenderWindowUISingleInheritance VTKExample):

CMakeLists:
find_package(VTK COMPONENTS
	# insert the following:
	vtkGUISupportQt
otherwise you'll get an error in CMake GUI: "GuiSupportQt not found."


Make sure your executable folder (e.g.: RelWithDebInfo) contains the following Qt DLL's:
Qt5Core.dll
Qt5Gui.dll
Qt5Widgets.dll
Important: They must be from Qt/5."whatever"/msvc2017_64 !!!!
otherwise you'll get error dialogs when running the project executable, related to the missing Qt5 components:
for example:
"The procedure entry point
?eventFilter@QAbstractItemView@@MEAA_NPEAVQObject@@PEAV
QEvent@@@Z could not be located in the dynamic link library VTK\bin\vtkGUISupportQt-8.2.dll"


If you want to rename the whole project with all class and ui names you need to do the following:
1) Remove all contents of build folder (provided you have all the necessary Qt libs copied somewhere else)
2) Rename *.h, *.cxx, *.ui and .*Driver.cxx files and all their contents (classes etc.)
3) Configure from CMakeGUI
4) Compile and run, even though it will fail, since the exe folder does not contain qt libs
5) add qt libs to the exe folder
